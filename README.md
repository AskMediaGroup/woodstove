Woodstove HTTP API Framework
============================

Woodstove is a framework for creating API services over HTTP. It provides
simple mechanisms for exposing API functions including authentication, access
control, argument validation, and asynchronous execution.

BIG NOTE ABOUT CODE USABILITY
=============================

We have decided to push the woodstove codebase up to github in a currently
unusable state. There are still known bugs and functional problems that have
cropped up as we have been extracting Ask.com specific code and generally
cleaning things up. We feel that it is more important for us to start getting
used to working out of the opensource project on github than it is for the
code to actually work at this point.

So as it stands now woodstove is a work in progress that we will be actively
working on until our internal services that run in the framework are all using
this codebase. At which point we will remove this note!
